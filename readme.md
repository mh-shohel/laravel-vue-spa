## A Sample project to learn how to work VueJS SPA with Laravel

I've trying to cover all features available in VueJS, this project is fully ready and you've to nothing extra to run it. Just clone this project, connect with database, import database from sql-backup located at root. In this project, vue will get your API url automatically from Laravel Route. All of Laravel routes you can access dynamically at VueJS with same name you give at laravel route.

See the live example at project
